# Welcome to HoverStop Documentation

HoverStop is a community-run organization that is developing highly customized flight simulator peripherals to life!
This website is our documentation hub which is built from all our open source documentation in our github repo at github.com/hover-stop/docs.

Most of our collaboration is happening in Discord [here](https://discord.gg/WCNswgCXFP).
Please come and join us and be part of the conversation!

If you want to support us, we would welcome your input!
All we ask is that you read some of the general guidance below to help us keep our quality bar high and the content accessable to all users!

Don't worry if the engineering part of the project isn't your thing, your input is still welcome and if you want to help cover some of the overheads of the group, consider buying us a coffe or two using this link:

## General Guidelines

### Style

Please make sure that the documents are written in the style that is appropriate for the content, i.e. a build guide should be clear, precise, and have a logical flow.
Try not to use acronyms and be consistent with the terms you use to refer to things (i.e. if you're talking about a mounting plate, refer to it as that and not a plate or panel or other somesuch)!

### Conventions

#### Language
We are a dispersed team that spans continents and languages.
Use technical English (US or EN) to write.

#### Date and Time
Please use either YYYYMMDD (i.e. 20250405) or D MMM YY (5 Apr 2025) for dates.
For times use 24h format and include the timezone (i.e. 1930(UTC-7) or 1930PT).

## Technical Documentation

- **Measurements**: Always use metric units (millimeters) as the primary measurement, with imperial equivalents in parentheses if needed.
- **Components**: When referencing specific components, use the exact part number and name as listed in the technical data.
- **CAD Files**: Include links to the latest version of relevant CAD files when discussing design elements.
- **Tolerances**: Always specify manufacturing tolerances for critical dimensions.

## Build Guides

- **Prerequisites**: Start each guide with a clear list of required tools, skills, and components.
- **Safety First**: Include appropriate safety warnings for any procedures involving power tools, electronics, or potentially hazardous materials.
- **Photos**: Include high-quality images at key steps, with annotations pointing to important details.
- **Testing**: End each section with verification steps so builders can confirm successful completion before moving on.

## Supporting Users

- **Accessibility**: Write content that's accessible to users with different experience levels.
- **Troubleshooting**: Include common issues and their solutions at the end of each technical section.
- **Internationalization**: Avoid region-specific jargon or references that may not translate well globally.
- **Version Compatibility**: Clearly mark which hardware or firmware versions a particular instruction applies to.

## Community Contributions

- **Attribution**: Always credit community members when incorporating their designs, improvements, or documentation.
- **Feedback Loop**: When documenting a new feature or design, include the reasoning and community discussion that led to its development.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Mark documentation with version numbers and maintain a changelog to track significant updates.
- **Peer Review**: Submit significant documentation changes for community review before finalizing.
