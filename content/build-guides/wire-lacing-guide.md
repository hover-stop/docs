# Wire Lacing Guide

This guide provides instructions for wire lacing, a method of organizing and securing wire bundles using lacing cord. Wire lacing is a durable and space-efficient alternative to cable ties, commonly used in aerospace and aviation applications.

## Materials Needed
- Lacing cord (nylon or waxed polyester)
- Scissors or a sharp knife
- Heatshrink tubing (optional, for securing ends)

## General Guidelines
- Follow FAA AC 43.13-1B, Chapter 11 for wire lacing standards.
- Use a single loop or continuous lacing pattern, depending on the application.
- Avoid overtightening the lacing cord to prevent damage to the wires.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Wire Bundle
- Group wires logically based on their destination or function.
- Align the wires neatly and ensure there are no sharp bends or kinks.

### 2. Start the Lacing
- Begin at one end of the wire bundle.
- Tie a secure knot (e.g., a square knot) around the bundle to anchor the lacing cord.

### 3. Apply the Lacing Pattern
- For single loop lacing:
  - Wrap the cord around the bundle at regular intervals (e.g., every 25â€“50mm).
  - Tie a knot at each loop to secure it.
- For continuous lacing:
  - Wrap the cord in a spiral pattern along the length of the bundle.
  - Tie a knot at the end to secure the lacing.

### 4. Secure the Ends
- Trim any excess lacing cord.
- Optionally, apply heatshrink tubing over the knots for additional security.

### 5. Inspect the Lacing
- Ensure the lacing is tight enough to hold the wires securely but not so tight that it damages the insulation.
- Check for consistent spacing and neatness.

## Tips
- Use contrasting lacing cord colors for easy identification of wire bundles.
- Avoid lacing wires that may need frequent reconfiguration; use cable ties instead.
- Document the lacing pattern and materials used for future reference.
