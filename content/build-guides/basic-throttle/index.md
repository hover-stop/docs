# Basic Throttle Quadrant

This guide will walk you through building a basic throttle quadrant for flight simulators.

## Overview

The Basic Throttle Quadrant is designed for general aviation simulation and provides:
- Single engine throttle control
- Mixture control
- Prop pitch control
- Simple trim wheel

## Materials Needed

- 3D printed parts (STL files provided below)
- 3x 10k linear potentiometers
- 1x rotary encoder with push button
- Arduino Pro Micro (or compatible)
- 22 AWG wire
- M3 screws and nuts
- Mini USB cable

## Assembly Steps

### Step 1: Print the Components

Download the STL files from our repository and print them using the following settings:
- 0.2mm layer height
- 20% infill
- PLA or PETG material

### Step 2: Prepare the Electronics

Wire the potentiometers according to the schematic below.

### Step 3: Assembly

Mount the potentiometers in their designated slots.

## Programming Instructions

Upload the provided Arduino sketch to configure your throttle.

## Testing and Calibration

Follow these steps to calibrate your throttle in your simulator.
