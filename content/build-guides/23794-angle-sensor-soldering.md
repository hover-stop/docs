# Soldering Wires onto the 23794 Angle Sensor, Hall Effect

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for soldering wires onto the turret terminals of the 23794 Angle Sensor, Hall Effect. Follow these steps to ensure a neat, reliable solder joint.

## 1. Prepare & Protect the Work Area
- Secure the sensor or workpiece using a vise or “helping hands” clamp to avoid movement.
- Organize your materials (soldering iron, solder, flux, wire strippers, small pliers).
- Set your soldering iron to about **350–375°C (660–710°F)**.

## 2. Strip & Tin the Wire
- Strip about **10–12 mm** (or as required) of insulation.
  - Aim for a clean strip without nicking wire strands.
  - A thermal stripper or calibrated mechanical stripper works best.
- Apply a thin layer of flux to the exposed wire (optional but helpful).
- Tin the exposed wire by heating it briefly and applying solder.
  - Move the wire across the iron tip from insulation toward the end and off, so solder doesn’t wick under the insulation.
  - Leave a small gap between the insulation and the start of the tinning.

## 3. Form the 180° Hook
- Use small round-nose pliers or chain-nose pliers to bend the tinned wire into a “hook” about **180°**.
  - This hook can be **180°**, **270°**, or a full **360° loop**, depending on your specifications.
  - A **180° hook** makes later removal easier if needed.

## 4. Position the Hook onto the Turret Terminal
- Place the hooked wire on the lower section of the turret so the wire lays flush against the board (if present).
- Ensure you maintain a small gap between the insulation and terminal.
  - This prevents melted insulation from flowing into the solder joint.

## 5. Solder the Connection
- Clean the iron tip (wire brush + damp sponge).
- Touch the iron to the turret and wire, then apply a small amount of solder to form a “bridge.”
  - This improves heat conduction and helps solder flow around the connection.
- Feed additional solder from the opposite side of the iron.
- Keep the iron in place just long enough for solder to flow and wet all surfaces.
- Remove the iron with a smooth, wiping motion.
- Allow the solder to solidify without moving the wire.

## 6. Inspect & Clean
- A good joint should be shiny and show a slightly concave “fillet” where the wire meets the turret.
  - No excess lumps or large blobs—aim for “solder for inspectability,” where you can see wire strands and the turret outline.
- Lightly tug the wire to ensure it is secure.
- Clean away flux residue if needed (e.g., with isopropyl alcohol).

### Tip
If you must solder multiple wires onto the same turret, keep them stacked with insulation contacting each other. Leave the required insulation gap to avoid melting into the wire. Always heat, apply solder, and remove the iron in one motion—this reduces the chance of a cold joint.
